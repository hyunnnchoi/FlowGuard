# Flowguard

### ðŸ“‹ Overview
This project is an IoT-based storm drain blockage detection system that uses ESP32 devices with infrared sensors to monitor storm drains for blockages due to debris or foreign materials. The system operates in real-time, with each IoT device transmitting data to a central server three times a day via MQTT and NB-IoT. The server collects, processes, and stores this data in a PostgreSQL database, making it available for visualization and monitoring.

### ðŸš€ Features
- Real-time blockage detection using infrared sensors.
- Scalable architecture to support up to 550,000 devices.
- MQTT-based data transmission for efficient, low-power communication.
- PostgreSQL database storage for structured data handling.
- Integration-ready for visualization tools like Grafana.
